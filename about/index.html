      <p>Our dataset contains the matching data of England Premier League from the past 20 seasons (1993-1994 to 2014-2015). The fields include information such as the name of teams, match results, match statistics (e.g. number of shots, number of corners, etc.) and handicap figures of large bet companies. The dataset is evaluated according to the 4 “C”s:</p>

      <h5><strong>Completeness</strong></h5>

      <p>Not every column in the dataset exists in some early seasons. Because the data has a large time lapse almost as long as the history of England premier league, it is easy to understand that there are no records on the number of shots or the odds of a match in 1990s. The table below shows some example on what part of the data is missing for some seasons:</p>

      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Data Fields</th>
            <th scope="col">Existing Seasons</th>
            <th scope="col">Missing Seasons</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Basic Info (team name, match results)</td>
            <td>all seasons</td>
            <td>-</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Half time results</td>
            <td>1995-1996 and after</td>
            <td>1993-1994, 1994-1995</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Game statistics (e.g. shots, shots on target, number of audience, corners)</td>
            <td>2000-2001 and after</td>
            <td>1993-1994 until 1999-2000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Odds from William Hill, Ladbrokes and Sportingbet</td>
            <td>2000-2001 and after</td>
            <td>1993-1994 until 1999-2000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Odds from Sporting Odds</td>
            <td>2003-2004</td>
            <td>all other seasons</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>According to the table above, the dataset gives very limited information before season 2000-2001, but data after that time is much more complete. Moreover, no missing values are observed from the game statistics after season 2000-2001, and very few values are missing for betting odds. Those facts makes the dataset complete enough for our study after cleaning by removing unnecessary rows/columns and filling several missing values.</p>

      <h5><strong>Coherence</strong></h5>

      <p>We think the data is coherent after analyzing it in the aspects listed below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coherence between different bookmakers:</strong> the odds on the same game from different bookmakers are similar, and a smaller odd is always given to a preferred team (e.g. Manchester United vs a mid-level team).</li>
        <li><strong>Coherence on number of matches:</strong> the total number of game in a season stays the same as expected, and each team played equal number of games both in home kit and away kit.</li>
        <li><strong>Coherence on match stats:</strong> verified based on simple heuristics. For example, game result should stay coherent with number of goals, number of goals is no more than number of shots on target, half time goals should be no more than full time goals, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5><strong>Correctness</strong></h5>

      <p>
        In general, the dataset can be divided into 2 parts: match information and match odds. We verified the former part by searching the match information of a specific game online, and found no error on our sampled games. This convinced us that the dataset should be at least correct in most of the match results and match statistics. However, the historical odds from different bookmakers is not that easy to be found and verified. Only several of the bookmakers provide archived data on their odds. After some efforts, we verified the odds on bet365 should be correct, but there are still odds remaining to be verified later.
      </p>

      <h5><strong>Accountability</strong></h5>

      <p>
        This dataset is collected from <a href="https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/tree/master/football-data.co.uk">a github repository</a>, which contains the match statistics and odds for leagues from multiple countries in multiple levels, and we are only taking the England Premier League data for our study. The collection and original sources of their data is indicated in the readme file, and their resources shows a high accountability. The processed dataset can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MJUgjfGfDV-_z2qQJn4Mf5esrCtSxMUt/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
